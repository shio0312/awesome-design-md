## Overview

Custo operates as an industrial product gallery: a warm gunmetal canvas hosts the physical product while oversized display typography serves as the primary visual ornament. The system is rigorously achromatic — zero chromatic colors — letting the dark anodized mailbox and the geometric weight of a single sans-serif carry all brand personality. Every screen balances generous negative space against one monumental typographic statement, with the brand wordmark recurring as a near-architectural element. Surfaces are flat and matte; depth is implied by the product's own reflectivity rather than drop shadows or gradients.

## Color Palette

- **Canvas Gunmetal**: `#9ea29f` — Hero and feature-section background — the warm gray-green tint distinguishes Custo from generic white SaaS canvases and reads as architectural concrete rather than digital surface [neutral]
- **Obsidian**: `#000000` — Primary text, hairline borders, icon strokes — the highest-contrast ink in the system, used for headings and structural dividers [neutral]
- **Paper White**: `#ffffff` — Body section backgrounds, reversed text on gunmetal canvas, text on the dark product photography [neutral]
- **Anodized Graphite**: `#4b514d` — Dark surface for product photography, secondary headings, and elevated text — echoes the mailbox finish so the UI and product share a material [neutral]
- **Brushed Steel**: `#8e9194` — Muted body text, list dividers, secondary icon strokes — sits between Paper White and Obsidian for inline metadata and subdued links [neutral]
- **Linen Mist**: `#a7aaad` — Light border and divider color for headings and section rules — a hairline tone that never competes with Obsidian structural lines [neutral]
- **Aluminum Hairline**: `#d8d8d8` — Input field borders, footer separators, the lightest structural line — appears only where a near-invisible boundary is needed [neutral]

## Typography

- **PP Neue Montreal**

## Type Scale

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| caption | 15 | — | 1.43 |
| subheading | 20 | — | 1.38 |
| heading-sm | 30 | — | 1.25 |
| heading | 38 | — | 1.15 |
| display | 57 | — | 1 |

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1280px
- **Card Padding**: 20px
- **Element Gap**: 24px
- **Section Gap**: 110px
- **Border Radius**: {'cards': '8px', 'images': '8px', 'inputs': '8px', 'buttons': '31.35px (pill) for primary action; 8px for secondary'}

## Layout

The page model is a vertically stacked single column with a max content width of ~1280px centered in the viewport. The hero breaks full-bleed as Canvas Gunmetal #9ea29f from edge to edge, with the mailbox photograph centered-right and the 57px CUSTO® wordmark anchoring the bottom. Below the hero, sections alternate: a 2-column text block (small caption left, large heading right), followed by a horizontal 3-card product image grid, then 2-column text-image rows where body copy alternates sides. Section gaps are 110px, creating strong vertical breathing room. Navigation is a single transparent top bar that becomes Paper White on scroll. The CES badge is a fixed bottom-right floater. The overall rhythm is gallery-like: few elements per section, large type, wide gaps, and the product photograph as the visual punctuation between text bands.

## Surfaces / Elevation

- **Gunmetal Hero Canvas**
- **Paper White**
- **Anodized Graphite**

## Imagery

Imagery is exclusively product photography of the Custo mailbox, shot in three modes: full-body hero portrait on the gunmetal canvas, lifestyle shots showing a person interacting with the unit, and extreme close-ups of the scanning interface and LED ring. All photography shares a desaturated, high-key treatment with the mailbox's matte black finish as the consistent visual anchor. No illustrations, no abstract graphics, no stock photography. Photographs are contained within 8px-radius cards or used full-bleed behind the 57px display wordmark. The CES award badge is the only piece of multicolor artwork on the entire site.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Set the 57px display wordmark in Paper White directly on the Canvas Gunmetal #9ea29f hero so the type reads as part of the product silhouette rather than floating above it
- Use a single 1px border in Obsidian #000000 or Paper White #ffffff for all interactive elements — never introduce fills, gradients, or shadows on buttons or cards
- Apply 31.35px pill radius exclusively to the primary action button ('Order now'); use 8px radius for every other input, card, and secondary button
- Maintain the 110px vertical section gap between content bands and alternate between Canvas Gunmetal and Paper White to create the gallery rhythm
- Keep body text at 19px / 1.42 and reserve 30px+ sizes for actual section headings — never use the display scale for body copy or UI labels
- Source product photography on Anodized Graphite #4b514d backgrounds so the mailbox material and the UI surface share the same value
- Enable "kern" and "liga" OpenType features on all PP Neue Montreal text to preserve the geometric spacing at large display sizes

### Don't

- Do not introduce any chromatic color — no blues, reds, greens, or purples for buttons, accents, or status states; the system is intentionally achromatic
- Do not use drop shadows, inner shadows, or glow effects on cards, buttons, or images; depth comes from the gunmetal/white alternation only
- Do not set the 57px display type in a condensed, italic, or different font family — PP Neue Montreal Medium at 400 is the only display voice
- Do not use borders thicker than 1px; the entire system relies on hairline structure and thicker rules would break the gallery feel
- Do not place the primary action button as a filled solid — all CTAs remain ghost/outlined so the gunmetal canvas stays visible
- Do not use background colors other than Canvas Gunmetal, Paper White, or Anodized Graphite for full-bleed sections
- Do not break the 4px spacing base; pad and gap values must snap to multiples of 4 (18, 20, 24, 32, 40)

## Components

### Ghost Pill Button (Primary Action)

Transparent background, 1px white border on gunmetal canvas or 1px Obsidian border on white sections, Paper White or Obsidian text, 31.35px pill radius, ~16px vertical / ~28px horizontal padding, PP Neue Montreal at 16px / 1.62. No fill state; hover inverts fill and text color.

### Text Link with Arrow

Underlined text link in Obsidian or Paper White (reversed on gunmetal) with a right-arrow glyph. 15–16px PP Neue Montreal, 1.43–1.62 line-height, 15px padding-bottom for the underline to breathe.

### Display Wordmark

57px PP Neue Montreal Medium, line-height 1.00, set in Paper White on the gunmetal hero so it bleeds into the product silhouette. Registered-trademark glyph sits to the right as a circle-stroke mark.

### Product Image Card

8px border-radius, Paper White or transparent surface, 1px Linen Mist border optional, full-bleed photograph with no overlay text. Three-up grid on desktop, single column on mobile.
