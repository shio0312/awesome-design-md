## Overview

Uber's interface is a disciplined black-on-white transit kiosk: every screen is a white canvas anchored by a single black navigation bar, a black footer, and solid black controls, with zero chromatic UI color. All color in the system lives inside flat editorial illustrations — a packed suitcase, two riders in a car, a bowl of food — that float beside the form rather than within it. Typography is custom and confident: UberMove at 52px for headlines with tight 1.22 line-height, UberMoveText at 14–18px for everything else, and a single weight (400) does the work that other systems spread across three. Components are flat, borders are 1px hairline grays, and radii are binary — 8px for cards, inputs, and standard buttons, or a full 999px pill for nav CTAs and toggles. The only structural rhythm break is the sticky black 'See prices' bar that follows scroll, a persistent commitment to the next conversion.

## Color Palette

- **Jet Black**: `#000000` — Headings, body text, top navigation bar, footer background, filled controls, sticky bottom bar, location pin icons — the achromatic anchor that gives the white canvas its structure [neutral]
- **Paper White**: `#ffffff` — Page background, card surfaces, text on dark bars, input fields — the dominant canvas that every other element sits on [neutral]
- **Mist Gray**: `#f6f6f6` — Suggestion card backgrounds, subtle section washes, input field fills, nav hover states — a single step off white that creates depth without contrast [neutral]
- **Charcoal**: `#333333` — Secondary headings, footer column titles, darker body text variant — used when pure black feels too heavy on dense surfaces [neutral]
- **Iron Gray**: `#767676` — Input field borders, divider lines, placeholder-adjacent borders — the workhorse hairline color [neutral]
- **Ash Gray**: `#afafaf` — Muted helper text, disabled-link text, secondary metadata in body copy — disappears by design [neutral]
- **Slate**: `#5e5e5e` — Body text on light surfaces where full black would feel aggressive, secondary paragraph copy [neutral]
- **Graphite**: `#4b4b4b` — Supporting neutral for secondary UI, dividers, and muted labels. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color [neutral]
- **Faded Teal**: `#9dcdd6` — Blue supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. [accent]

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1200px
- **Card Padding**: 24px
- **Element Gap**: 16px

- **Border Radius**: {'tabs': '8px', 'cards': '8px', 'pills': '9999px', 'inputs': '8px', 'buttons': '8px'}

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered container with full-bleed black bars for nav and footer. Hero is a two-column split: left holds the headline + form stack (city picker, toggle, two inputs, CTA), right holds a square illustration panel. The 'Suggestions' section is a 3-column card grid with 16px gaps. The account section mirrors the hero split — text left, illustration right. 'Plan for later' is a full-width tabbed content area. Footer is a 4-column link grid on a black band. A sticky black 'See prices' bar persists at the viewport bottom across all scroll positions. Section gaps are ~64px, creating a calm vertical rhythm. The layout is strictly left-aligned for text — no centered body copy, no asymmetric text blocks.

## Imagery

All visual color lives inside flat editorial illustrations — no photography, no 3D, no gradients. Illustrations are vector-flat with hard edges and a limited palette of warm oranges, deep teals, cobalt blue, sandy tans, and warm browns. Scenes depict service scenarios: a packed suitcase for travel, two riders in a car for the account section, a food bowl for delivery, a shopping basket for packages. Illustrations are always contained in bounded panels beside text — never full-bleed, never overlapping type. They serve as emotional anchors for each service category while the surrounding UI stays strictly achromatic. Icon style is minimal: solid black glyphs for location pins, clock, arrows, and social marks, with no multicolor or outlined alternatives.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Use #000000 for all filled buttons, the navigation bar, the footer, and the sticky bottom bar — these three black bands are the system's structural rhythm
- Use UberMove at 52px weight 400 for the primary headline; never bold it to 700
- Use 8px border-radius for all cards, inputs, and standard buttons; use 9999px only for nav CTAs and mode toggles
- Keep all UI elements achromatic — let illustrations carry color, not controls or text
- Use 1px #767676 hairline borders for input fields; never use box-shadows for separation
- Apply 64px section gaps and 16px element gaps as the default vertical rhythm
- Use #f6f6f6 for card backgrounds when the card sits directly on a #ffffff page surface

### Don't

- Don't introduce chromatic accent colors into buttons, links, or interactive controls — the system is intentionally monochrome in its UI layer
- Don't use box-shadows or drop shadows on cards, modals, or inputs — depth comes from surface color steps, not elevation
- Don't bold UberMove headlines above weight 400; the system speaks at normal weight, not display-bold
- Don't use 9999px radius on cards or inputs — pill radius is reserved for nav CTAs and trip-mode toggles
- Don't use centered body copy; text is always left-aligned within the 1200px max-width container
- Don't let illustrations bleed beyond their bounding panels or overlap surrounding type
- Don't use the #9dcdd6 teal outside of the tab strip — it is a single-purpose active-state signal, not a general accent

## Components

### Black Filled Button

Solid #000000 background, #ffffff text in UberMoveText 16px weight 400. 8px border-radius, 12px vertical padding × 16px horizontal padding. No shadow, no border, no hover state variation visible. Text is left-padded to clear the label; on mobile it stretches full-width.

### White Pill Button

#ffffff background, #000000 text in UberMoveText 14px weight 400. 9999px border-radius (full pill), 6px vertical × 16px horizontal padding. Inverts the black-bar context it sits inside — the white pill is the only thing that breaks the black nav.

### Location Input Field

#ffffff background with a 1px #767676 border, 8px radius. 16px vertical padding. Left side has a vertical timeline track with a black filled circle (pickup) and black square (dropoff) connected by a thin line. Placeholder text in UberMoveText 16px weight 400, #000000. An arrow icon sits right-aligned in the pickup row.

### Trip Type Toggle

Full-pill 9999px radius container with #f6f6f6 background. Active state shows a clock icon + 'Pickup now' label in UberMoveText 16px. Inactive state is bare text. Sits directly above the input stack as a compact mode selector.

### Suggestion Card

#f6f6f6 background, 8px border-radius, no border, no shadow. Two-column internal layout: left column holds an UberMoveText 16px weight 500 title and 14px weight 400 description in #5e5e5, plus a 'Details' link in weight 500 underlined. Right column holds a flat illustration (~120px wide) showing a car, calendar, or food bowl. Cards sit in a 3-column grid with 16px gaps.

### Top Navigation Bar

#000000 background, full-width, ~56px height. Left: Uber wordmark in white UberMove. Center: nav links (Ride, Earn, Business, Uber Eats, About) in UberMoveText 14px weight 400 #ffffff, with a dropdown chevron on About. Right: globe icon + 'EN', 'Help' link, 'Log in' link, then the white pill 'Sign up' button. 16px horizontal padding on the link cluster.

### Sticky Bottom Bar

#000000 background, full-width, ~56px height, position fixed to viewport bottom. Single centered label 'See prices' in #ffffff UberMoveText 16px weight 400. No button chrome — the entire bar IS the button. Overlays content with no shadow separator.

### Section Heading

UberMove 36px weight 400 in #000000, line-height 1.22. Left-aligned, sits at the start of each section with 32–48px of top margin. No decorative elements, no accent color, no underline — the weight of the size and the cleanness of the typeface do all the work.

### Tab Strip

Horizontal row of tabs in UberMoveText 16px weight 400 #000000. Active tab has a #9dcdd6 background fill spanning the tab width with 8px radius; inactive tabs are bare text with 16px horizontal padding. Single chromatic UI element in the entire system.

### Footer

#000000 background spanning full width. Top region has a 'Visit Help Center' link in white. Four-column link grid (Company, Products, Global citizenship, Travel) with column titles in #ffffff weight 500 16px and links in #afafaf weight 400 14px, 12px row gap. Bottom row: social icons (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, X) on the left, language/location selectors on the right, app store badges below. 64px vertical padding top and bottom.

### Illustration Panel

Contained rectangular panels (~480px wide) holding flat vector illustrations. The suitcase scene uses warm oranges (#c44a1 area), deep teals, and sandy tans. The rider portrait uses solid cobalt blue (#276ef1 area) and warm browns. No gradients, no 3D, no photography — all flat fills with hard edges. Illustrations carry all the color in the system; the UI around them stays strictly achromatic.

### City Picker Pill

Black filled circle (6px) followed by 'Barcelona, ES' in UberMoveText 18px weight 500 #000000, then a light gray pill containing 'Change city' in 14px weight 500. Sits above the hero headline as a compact location context.

Example Component Prompts:

1. Build the hero form: white #ffffff page background. City picker at top — black dot + 'City, Region' in UberMoveText 18px weight 500, followed by a #f6f6f6 pill containing 'Change city' in 14px weight 500. Headline below: 'Go anywhere with [Brand]' in UberMove 52px weight 400 #000000. Then a #f6f6f6 full-pill (9999px) toggle showing clock icon + 'Pickup now' in UberMoveText 16px. Two stacked input fields: #ffffff background, 1px #767676 border, 8px radius, 16px padding, left icon (filled circle for pickup, filled square for dropoff) connected by a vertical line, placeholder text 'Pickup location' / 'Dropoff location' in UberMoveText 16px #000000. Solid black #000000 button below: UberMoveText 16px weight 400 #ffffff, 8px radius, 12px 16px padding, label 'See prices'.

2. Build a suggestion card grid: 3-column layout on a #ffffff page, 16px gap between cards. Each card: #f6f6f6 background, 8px radius, 24px padding, no border, no shadow. Two-column internal layout — left 60% holds a title in UberMoveText 16px weight 500 #000000, a description in 14px weight 400 #5e5e5e, and a 'Details' link in 14px weight 500 #000000 underlined. Right 40% holds a flat vector illustration ~120px wide (car / calendar / food bowl / shopping basket).

3. Build the top navigation bar: full-width #000000 background, 56px height, flex row. Left: brand wordmark in #ffffff UberMove 20px weight 700. Center: nav links 'Ride', 'Earn', 'Business', 'Uber Eats', 'About' in UberMoveText 14px weight 400 #ffffff, 16px horizontal gap, with a small chevron after 'About'. Right cluster: globe icon + 'EN', then 'Help' text link, then 'Log in' text link, then a white #ffffff pill button 'Sign up' with 9999px radius, 6px 16px padding, text in UberMoveText 14px weight 400 #000000.

4. Build the sticky bottom bar: position fixed, bottom 0, full-width, 56px height, #000000 background. Center-aligned label 'See prices' in UberMoveText 16px weight 400 #ffffff. No border, no shadow, no rounded corners — the bar touches both viewport edges.

5. Build the tab strip: horizontal flex row, each tab is 16px horizontal padding, UberMoveText 16px weight 400 #000000. Active tab: full-width #9dcdd6 background fill, 8px radius. Inactive tabs: no background. 0px gap between tabs — the colored fill defines the active boundary.
