## Overview

Vivid+Co operates in a cinematic dark void: near-black canvas at #101010–#495764, punctuated by a single near-white off-white (#fffdf9) used for nearly all type and UI chrome. Typography is overwhelmingly Neue Montreal weight 400 — a deliberate refusal of bold, where authority comes from sheer scale (136px and 105px display) rather than weight. The signature device is the chromatic-prism hero rendering: RGB-split blocks of saturated red/green/blue light bleeding through glass cubes, breaking an otherwise monochrome surface. Layout is centered and roomy; nav, body, and links all wear the same #fffdf9 color with no separate accent button, no fills, and zero shadows — differentiation happens through spacing, scale, and the rainbow artifact that acts as the brand's only chromatic voice.

## Color Palette

- **Bone White**: `#fffdf9` — Primary text, nav labels, link color, heading fill — the near-white that occupies every typographic surface across the dark canvas [neutral]
- **Obsidian**: `#101010` — Page canvas, background fill for hero and section bands — the deep black the prism artifact sits inside [neutral]
- **Graphite Veil**: `#495764` — Dominant surface behind headings and content blocks — a cool dark slate that gives the canvas depth without flat black [neutral]
- **Ash Border**: `#403f3f` — Hairline divider and card outline — barely visible, used at 1px to separate rows without competing with type [neutral]
- **Fog Blue**: `#6f879c` — Muted secondary text and ghost-button labels (3.7:1 contrast) — service-category labels like Strategy, Creative, Communications + marketing read as de-emphasized metadata [neutral]
- **Pure Black**: `#000000` — Decorative SVG icon and illustration fill — used in the prism artwork and icon glyphs; not a background [neutral]
- **Prism Red**: `#ff2a2a` — Chromatic dispersion accent — one channel of the RGB-split prism hero artifact; appears only inside the brand illustration, not as a UI token [accent]
- **Prism Cyan**: `#2a7fff` — Chromatic dispersion accent — blue channel of the RGB-split prism, paired with red and green to create the signature caustics effect [accent]
- **Prism Lime**: `#2aff2a` — Chromatic dispersion accent — green channel of the RGB-split prism artifact [accent]

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1440px
- **Card Padding**: 20px
- **Element Gap**: 7px
- **Section Gap**: 108px
- **Border Radius**: {'nav': '5px', 'tags': '9999px', 'cards': '15px', 'buttons': '0px'}

## Layout

Full-bleed dark canvas with a single max-width ~1440px content column. Hero pattern: centered prism artifact with overlapping headline (text crosses the cubes) and left-aligned subtitle beneath. Navigation sits in a thin top bar with the wordmark left, four ghost links right, and an outlined Contact button terminating the row. Section rhythm alternates between full-viewport-height hero panels and narrower content bands at ~108px gaps. Content arrangement is asymmetric: the prism artifact anchors the visual center while headlines wrap around it. Single-column text blocks max out around 440px width; no multi-column grids, no card matrices, no pricing tables. Footer is a thin hairline-divided band with two columns of metadata.

## Imagery

Single hero artifact dominates: an abstract 3D rendering of glass cubes with RGB-split chromatic aberration edges. No photography, no human imagery, no product shots. The prism IS the brand image — everything else is monochrome typography on dark canvas. Iconography is minimal: thin-line navigation labels and a small cursor/glyph accent (area 142765) at the end of one headline suggest a single 16px monoline icon. No illustrations, no decorative patterns, no textures.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Use #fffdf9 for all text and interactive elements on the dark canvas — never introduce a second text color unless it is #6f879c for de-emphasized metadata.
- Let scale carry hierarchy: pair 136px display with 18px body at a 7.5× ratio rather than bolding the body to compensate.
- Hold Neue Montreal weight 400 as the default; reserve weight 700 exclusively for 36px subheadings.
- Set display headlines at line-height 1.00–1.01 and -0.02em letter-spacing so multi-line stacks feel sculptural.
- Use 0px border-radius for buttons and most cards — the prism artwork supplies all the visual softness the system needs.
- Center hero compositions vertically and horizontally, leaving ~50% viewport height for the headline block.
- Apply the prism artifact at full scale as the only chromatic element; never dilute it with accent buttons or colored badges.

### Don't

- Don't introduce filled buttons, gradients, or saturated action colors — the system has no distinct primary action color and the nav's outlined Contact button is the only bordered UI element.
- Don't use weight 600–800 for headlines; authority comes from size (105–136px), not stroke weight.
- Don't apply box-shadows to cards or nav — depth comes from the Prism artifact and the slate-to-black canvas gradient.
- Don't add line-heights above 1.5 to display sizes; the tight 1.00–1.01 leading at 136px is a signature.
- Don't use letter-spacing looser than -0.01em on any size above 22px — the tracking is intentionally tight.
- Don't split the prism colors into separate UI tokens — RGB red/cyan/green only exist inside the artifact.
- Don't lighten the canvas past #495764 or the slate-to-black contrast that makes #fffdf9 type read will collapse.

## Components

### Ghost Nav Button

Transparent fill, #fffdf9 text, 0px radius, no padding, uppercase Neue Montreal 14–15px. No underline, no border — letterforms alone carry identification.

### Outlined Contact Button

Transparent fill, 1px solid #fffdf9 border, 5px radius, padding 9px 15px, uppercase 14px #fffdf9 text. The only bordered element in the header.

### Ghost Service Label

Transparent fill, #6f879c text, 0px radius, 20px padding-top, 30px padding-bottom, 20px Neue Montreal. Reads as de-emphasized taxonomy — sits below case-study titles.

### Display Headline Block

Neue Montreal weight 400 at 105–136px, line-height 1.00, letter-spacing -0.02em, color #fffdf9. Stacks across multiple lines; occupies 50–60% of viewport height. No font-weight override — scale alone creates hierarchy.

### Hero Lead Paragraph

Neue Montreal 400 at 18–22px, line-height 1.5, #fffdf9, max-width ~440px. Aligns left beneath the prism artifact, never full-width.

### Prism Artifact

Four to six glass cubes arranged in a staggered cluster, rendered with #000000 cores, #fffdf9 specular highlights, and red/cyan/green channel-offset edges that bleed saturated color. No shadow — the chromatic dispersion is the visual depth.

### Section Heading

Neue Montreal 400 at 18–22px, #fffdf9, max-width ~440px, left-aligned above the larger display headline that follows.

### Footer Hairline Divider

1px solid #403f3f line, full-width, 15px margin-top. The only border-color token used in the system.

### Case Study Title Link

Neue Montreal 400 at 33px, #fffdf9, letter-spacing -0.01em, line-height 1.2. Hover state likely color-shifts to #6f879c — no underline, no background change.

### Eyebrow Label

Neue Montreal 400 at 32px or 17px, uppercase, line-height 1.01–1.5, letter-spacing +0.02em at 17px. All-caps treatment without weight 700 — restraint over shouting.

### Rounded Pill Tag

9999px border-radius, 15px radius also appears for card corners. Used sparingly; most of the UI is square-edged.

Example Component Prompts:
1. Hero section: #101010 canvas filling viewport. Prism artifact (4–6 glass cubes with #000000 cores and RGB-split #ff2a2a/#2a7fff/#2aff2a edges) centered at ~40% width. Headline 'We are Storytellers Strat egists Crea tives Market ers Tech nologists' at 136px Neue Montreal weight 400, #fffdf9, line-height 1.00, letter-spacing -2.72px, wrapping across the cubes. Subtitle at 22px weight 400 #fffdf9, max-width 440px, left-aligned below.
2. Ghost navigation button: transparent fill, #fffdf9 text, uppercase Neue Montreal 14px, 0px radius, 0px padding. Hover transitions color only via 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.52,0.01,0,1).
3. Outlined Contact button: transparent fill, 1px solid #fffdf9 border, 5px radius, 9px 15px padding, uppercase 14px #fffdf9 text. Only bordered element in the header.
4. Case-study title link: Neue Montreal 400 at 33px, #fffdf9, letter-spacing -0.33px, line-height 1.2, no underline. Below it a Fog Blue (#6f879c) service label at 20px with 20px padding-top and 30px padding-bottom.
5. Footer divider: 1px solid #403f3f line, full-width, 15px margin-top. Footer metadata at 14–18px #fffdf9 in a two-column row.

## Motion Philosophy

Expressive but restrained. Default duration 0.5s with ease for most transitions, but the signature curve cubic-bezier(0.52, 0.01, 0, 1) (150 occurrences) drives all meaningful state changes — a slow start and decisive stop, like optical focus pulling. Transform and opacity carry 90% of transitions; border-color and color handle the remaining 10%. One named animation kVfqLU runs at 6.65s — likely the prism artifact's slow chromatic shimmer. Avoid springs, bounces, or scale-pop effects; the system's confidence reads through stillness, not motion.
