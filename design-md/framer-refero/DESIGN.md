## Overview

Framer operates as a near-total darkness — a black canvas where content floats like neon signage in a gallery opening. Headlines set in GT Walsheim Medium with tight 0.8–1.1 line-height and aggressive negative tracking (-0.04em at 54px) create compressed display type that pushes forward instead of sitting politely on the page. A single electric blue (#0099ff) provides all functional accent — borders, glows, badges, active states — while the rest of the interface stays achromatic, relying on subtle gray steppings (#111, #171717, #242424) to carve depth out of pure black. Components feel engineered rather than decorated: rounded 8–25px radii, 1px hairline borders, minimal shadows, and ghost/translucent surfaces that let the void show through.

## Color Palette

- **Void**: `#000000` — Page canvas, nav background, card surfaces, icon fills — the infinite black that swallows all non-essential content [neutral]
- **Graphite**: `#111111` — Elevated card surfaces one step above the void — large feature cards and modal containers [neutral]
- **Obsidian**: `#171717` — Mid-tier surface for buttons, secondary cards, UI fills — separates interactive elements from the canvas [neutral]
- **Slate**: `#242424` — Hover states, input fields, and elevated panels — the brightest neutral before reaching text territory [neutral]
- **Ash**: `#333333` — Deep fill for inactive backgrounds and structural elements [neutral]
- **Smoke**: `#666666` — Disabled text, low-emphasis body copy, tertiary strokes [neutral]
- **Fog**: `#888888` — Borders, dividers, icon strokes — the structural outline color [neutral]
- **Mist**: `#999999` — Secondary body text, captions, metadata — readable but never competing with headlines [neutral]
- **Pearl**: `#cccccc` — Light body text for contrast pairs on dark surfaces [neutral]
- **Bone**: `#ffffff` — Primary headings, body text on dark canvas, button backgrounds — the sole light source [neutral]
- **Electric Blue**: `#0099ff` — Accent borders, glows, link underlines, badge outlines, active states — the only chromatic punctuation in the entire system [accent]
- **Deep Current**: `#00406b` — Dark accent fills and box-shadows paired with Electric Blue — the saturated shadow underneath blue glows [accent]
- **Midnight Tide**: `#002238` — Subtle blue-tinted surface washes and shadow tints — keeps the blue accent feeling atmospheric even in flat fills [accent]
- **Signal Green**: `#4cd963` — Green wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color [accent]
- **Vivid Violet**: `#0066ff` — Primary action button fill — the only place a solid chromatic button background appears in the interface [brand]
- **Alert Red**: `#ff0022` — Red wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color [accent]
- **Amber**: `#ffbb00` — Yellow wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color [accent]
- **Lime**: `#cbff00` — CSS token hint — secondary accent available in the design system but not actively surfaced in core pages [accent]

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1200px
- **Card Padding**: 45px
- **Element Gap**: 10px
- **Section Gap**: 80px
- **Border Radius**: {'nav': '15px', 'tags': '9999px', 'cards': '20px', 'icons': '8px', 'inputs': '8px', 'buttons': '9999px', 'largeCards': '25px', 'featureCards': '15px'}

## Layout

Full-width sections that bleed edge-to-edge on the black canvas, with content constrained to ~1200px max-width centered within. Hero is a left-aligned headline + single CTA pill, with the right side left intentionally empty — asymmetric, not centered. Sections alternate between type-only layouts (large headline + sub-text) and product-screenshot showcases. The 'Shipped with Framer' section uses a logo wall in a 4-column grid. The community section frames a product screenshot in a centered max-width container with rounded window chrome. Navigation is minimal — a thin top bar with left logo and right-aligned links, no sticky behavior visible. Section rhythm: generous 80px vertical gaps between sections, creating distinct islands of content floating in the void.

## Imagery

Product UI screenshots dominate — framed in simulated window chrome with traffic-light dots, the embedded app screenshots become the hero imagery. Logo wall for social proof uses white wordmarks on black with generous spacing. No photography, no illustration, no abstract graphics — the visual language is the product itself, displayed as live interface. Icon style: minimal, outlined, mono-white at small sizes. Density: text-dominant with occasional large product screenshot breaks. The visual space ratio heavily favors typography over imagery.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Use GT Walsheim Medium weight 500 at 44–68px for all display headings — never substitute a different geometric sans-serif for display type
- Set display headings with line-height 0.8–1.1 and letter-spacing -0.04em to -0.05em — the compression is signature
- Apply Electric Blue (#0099ff) exclusively as 1px borders, glows, and link accents — never as a filled surface in hero sections
- Use Vivid Violet (#0066ff) only for the primary CTA button background — it is the single filled chromatic button in the system
- Set all buttons and tags to 9999px border-radius — fully pill-shaped controls are non-negotiable
- Use card radii from the 15px → 20px → 25px scale — match radius to card importance, not to a single global value
- Keep section gaps at 80px and element gaps at 10px — the compact density with generous section breathing is intentional

### Don't

- Don't introduce additional accent colors beyond Electric Blue (#0099ff) and Vivid Violet (#0066ff) — the system is deliberately monochromatic with one accent
- Don't use #ffffff as a background fill for cards — white is reserved for text and primary CTAs, cards stay in the #111–#242424 range
- Don't apply box-shadows to standard cards — depth is communicated through luminance stepping (#000 → #111 → #171 → #242), not elevation
- Don't set body text below 12px — the minimum size protects readability against the dark canvas
- Don't use warm grays or chromatic neutrals — the palette is strictly cool/achromatic in its grays, with blue as the only chromatic direction
- Don't mix font families within a single text block — GT Walsheim for display, Inter for everything else, mono for code only
- Don't use border-radius values outside the defined scale (8, 15, 20, 25, 9999) — every radius in the system maps to a specific component type

## Components

### Primary Pill Button

Black background (#000000), white text (#ffffff), 9999px radius (fully pill-shaped), 10px 14px padding, font-weight 500 at 12px. No border, no shadow. The pill geometry is deliberate — fully rounded ends signal approachability against the void canvas. Used for 'Get started for free' in the hero.

### Ghost Translucent Button

Translucent white background (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)), white text, 8px radius, 10px 14px padding. Reads as frosted glass over the black canvas — lets background show through. Used for 'See Framer sites' and similar secondary CTAs.

### Solid Filled Button

White background (#ffffff), dark text, 8px radius, 10px 14px padding. The inverted version of the Ghost — solid white creates a flash of brightness in the dark layout. Used for navigation-adjacent actions.

### Dark Surface Button

Obsidian background (#171717) at full opacity, subtle text, 8px radius. Reads as a recessed control — visually quieter than the white pill, stronger than ghost.

### Large Pill Button

Black background, 9999px radius, generous 40px padding on all sides. The inflated pill shape creates a distinctive landing-page CTA — wider and taller than standard buttons, demanding focus. Used for hero conversion moments.

### Void Feature Card

Pure black (#000000) background, 25px radius, 10px padding internally. No shadow, no border — the card disappears into the canvas and is defined only by its content and the gap between it and surrounding elements. Minimalist to the extreme.

### Graphite Feature Card

#111111 background, 25px radius, 10px padding. Subtle elevation via luminance difference rather than shadow — the one-step lighter gray creates depth perception without breaking the flat aesthetic.

### Obsidian Content Card

#171717 background, 20px radius, 0px padding (content directly on surface). Used for tighter content groupings where the card itself is the container.

### Padded Showcase Card

Black background, 15px radius, 45px horizontal padding (asymmetric — tight top/bottom, generous sides). The asymmetric padding creates a cinematic feel for product screenshots and feature explanations.

### Blue Accent Border

1px solid #0099ff border applied to cards, inputs, or interactive containers. The only chromatic border in the system — when something needs to glow, it gets this electric blue outline.

### Electric Glow Shadow

rgba(0, 153, 255, 0.2) 0px 5px 5px 0px — the blue-tinted shadow that gives Electric Blue accents a halo effect. Applied sparingly to elements that need to feel 'switched on'.

### Community Feed Container

Rounded-rectangle container simulating a desktop application window — dark (#171717) header bar with traffic-light dots (red, yellow, green circles), rounded 15px outer radius. Used to frame product screenshots of the community feed feature. The window chrome makes the embedded UI feel like a live application rather than a static mockup.

### Ghost Navigation Link

Mist-colored (#999999) text at 12px sans-serif, no background, 4px row-gap between items. On hover transitions to white (#ffffff). The nav is quiet — it floats on the black canvas without claiming visual territory.

### Blue-Tinted Deep Surface

#002238 background — the only chromatic neutral in the system. Used as a background fill for sections that need to feel cool or atmospheric without introducing a strong accent color. Creates a subtle blue ambient temperature.

## Gradient System

Two gradients in active use:
- **Window fade**: linear-gradient(173deg, rgb(255, 255, 255) 32%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 74%) — simulates a light source hitting the top edge of dark product UI screenshots
- **Blue atmospheric wash**: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(0, 153, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(28, 28, 28, 0.5) 61%) — creates blue-to-dark transitions for accent sections, fading Electric Blue into the Obsidian surface

## Animation Philosophy

Motion is expressive but restrained: 0.75s durations dominate — slow enough to feel deliberate, fast enough to not block interaction. Timing functions lean on 'ease' almost universally (4855 uses). Named animation 'ghostFlow' suggests the ghost-button hover treatment (fade-in opacity transitions on translucent surfaces). Color transitions are the most common animated property. Backdrop filters use blur(3-5px) for frosted-glass effects on overlays. The system avoids bounce, spring, or overshoot — motion is linear and atmospheric, not playful.
