## Overview

Airbnb operates on a white-canvas, photograph-first vocabulary: nearly every screen is a quiet monochrome frame that lets full-bleem property imagery carry the experience, with a single saturated coral-red accent (Rausch) as the only chromatic punctuation for action. Typography is set in a custom geometric sans (Airbnb Cereal VF) at mostly small, confident sizes — 14px body, 16px UI, 22–28px section titles — with tight negative tracking and generous line-height that keeps dense listing cards readable. The interface is flat, borderless, and rounded: 12–14px radii on cards and controls, pill-shaped circular buttons, and soft layered shadows only for elevated overlays like the search bar. Everything else — cards, list items, links — relies on whitespace and hairlines rather than chrome.

## Color Palette

- **Rausch**: `#ff385c` — Red decorative accent for icons, marks, and small graphic details. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color [brand]
- **Rausch 600**: `#e00b41` — Pressed and dark-state variant of Rausch for hover/active surfaces of the brand accent [brand]
- **Hof**: `#222222` — Primary text, body copy, headings, icon strokes, and inverse backgrounds — a near-black neutral that anchors the entire achromatic system [neutral]
- **Foggy**: `#6a6a6a` — Secondary text, muted labels, helper copy, disabled icon fills, and subdued metadata beneath card titles [neutral]
- **Grey 500**: `#c1c1c1` — Disabled text, placeholder text in inputs, and muted icon strokes where state de-emphasis is required [neutral]
- **Bebe**: `#ebebeb` — Hairline borders, input underlines, dividers between list rows, and subtle separator lines [neutral]
- **Deco**: `#dddddd` — Card surface backgrounds for muted containers, skeleton placeholders, and disabled card states [neutral]
- **Faint**: `#f7f7f7` — Page canvas background, footer surface, and hover state for interactive surfaces — the soft off-white that sets the page apart from pure white cards [neutral]
- **White**: `#ffffff` — Elevated card surfaces, input fields, modals, and the primary surface against the off-white canvas [neutral]

- **Element Gap**: 12px
- **Section Gap**: 48px

## Layout

Full-bleed layout with no fixed max-width constraint — content stretches edge to edge within the viewport, with internal horizontal padding of approximately 40px on each side at desktop. The hero is the floating search capsule centered on a quiet white canvas with no hero image or headline — the search bar IS the hero. Below the search, the page flows into vertically stacked horizontal-scroll sections (4 rows visible: Popular homes, Great hotels, another city, Available next month), each at roughly 320px tall, separated by 48px vertical gaps. Each section uses a 7-up card grid with horizontal overflow and arrow navigation. The footer is a 3-column link grid on #f7f7f7 background, followed by a bottom bar with copyright, language/currency, and social icons. Navigation is a fixed top bar with centered tab navigation and right-aligned utility controls.

## Imagery

Photography dominates the visual system — full-bleed property images are the primary content type. All photographs are warm, well-lit interior and exterior shots of real homes and hotels, treated with natural color grading (no heavy filters or duotones). Images are tightly cropped at 1:1 aspect ratio for listing cards, filling the card edge with no margin. Icons throughout the interface are outlined, monochrome (#222222 stroke, ~16–20px), used sparingly for navigation categories and UI controls. The logo is the only multicolor graphic element (Rausch). No illustrations, no 3D renders, no abstract graphics — the visual language is pure photography + minimal monochrome iconography on a soft white canvas.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Set body text at 14px/400 in Hof (#222222) with 1.43 line-height — this is the content backbone.
- Use Rausch (#ff385c) exclusively for the brand logo, search submit, active wishlist hearts, and one primary action per surface. No other reds.
- Give all listing card images a 12px border-radius and let them overflow into the card edge — no padding between image and text below.
- Use border-radius: 9999px for the search bar, pill buttons, wishlist hearts, and circular icon buttons. Use 12px for listing cards and 8px for ghost buttons.
- Set section headings at 22px/500 with -0.0200em letter-spacing — the tight tracking is a geometric-sans signature at that size.
- Place the page canvas at #f7f7f7 and cards at #ffffff so elevation reads through value contrast, not just shadow.
- Keep property imagery full-bleed within its card frame — no margins, no decorative borders around photographs.

### Don't

- Don't introduce additional accent colors beyond Rausch — the 0% colorfulness of the interface is deliberate; every additional hue dilutes the brand.
- Don't use shadows on listing cards. The visual system uses flat surfaces with whitespace, not elevation, to separate content.
- Don't set body text below 12px — the scale bottoms out at 11px for badges only.
- Don't round corners at inconsistent radii — the system has exactly two sizes for cards (12px and 14px) and full-pill (9999px) for interactive controls.
- Don't use borders on listing cards. Separation comes from the off-white canvas vs white card surface, not from lines.
- Don't apply Rausch to text or decorative elements — it is an action color, not a brand paint color for backgrounds or headings.
- Don't use bold (700) for body or metadata text — 700 is reserved for the 28px page titles and 21px card-titles emphasis; everything else is 400–600.

## Components

### Search Bar (Floating Capsule)

Full-width rounded capsule (border-radius: 9999px), white surface (#ffffff), three segmented fields (Where, When, Who) separated by vertical dividers, 16px/500 labels with 14px/400 placeholder text in #6a6a6a. Surrounded by a layered shadow stack at 0/2/4/8px with decreasing opacity. Right-aligned circular submit button in Rausch (#ff385c), 48px diameter, white search icon, white-on-coral hover state. Container max-width approximately 880px, centered.

### Property Listing Card

Rounded container at 12–14px radius, no border, white or transparent background. Image area is the full card width at roughly 1:1 aspect with 12px radius, overflowing slightly with the heart wishlist icon in the top-right corner. Title below in 14px/500 #222222, truncated to one line. Metadata line (host type, dates) in 14px/400 #6a6a6a. Price line in 14px/400 #222222 with the price in 14px/600 #222222. No padding between image and text — they share a 12px gutter.

### Guest Favorite Badge

Small white pill (border-radius: 9999px), white #ffffff background, 12px/600 text in #222222, positioned in the top-left of listing card images. Padding approximately 6px 12px. Subtle shadow to separate from the photograph.

### Wishlist Heart Button

Circular transparent button (border-radius: 9999px), no background fill, positioned absolute top-right of card image. Heart icon stroke in white when inactive, fill in Rausch (#ff385c) when active. 48px touch target, icon centered at approximately 20px.

### Top Navigation Bar

Fixed top bar on white background, 80px height. Left: Airbnb logo in Rausch (#ff385c). Center: tab navigation (All, Homes, Experiences, Services) with icon + label pairs in 16px/500, active tab underlined with a 2px black (#222222) bar, inactive tabs in #6a6a6a. Right: 'Become a host' link in 14px/500 #222222, language globe icon, and hamburger menu button (circular, 40px, #f7f7f7 background).

### Circular Nav Button

### Pill Navigation Tab

Pill-shaped tab with icon + label, active state shows a 2px black underline beneath the icon. Inactive text in #6a6a6a, active in #222222. 16px/500. No background fill — sits directly on white.

### Section Title with Arrow

Title in 22px/500 #222222 with tight -0.02em tracking, followed by a right-pointing arrow icon in #222222 at the same baseline. No underline, no decoration — the arrow implies navigability. Right-aligned carousel arrows in circular 40px buttons with #f7f7f7 background and #222222 chevron.

### Social Icon Link

Circular icon-only button (border-radius: 9999px), 32px, transparent background, icon stroke or fill in #222222. Inline horizontal row in footer.

### Language/Currency Selector

Inline text + icon pair, 14px/500 #222222, globe icon to the left. No background, no border. Sits between the copyright text and social icons at the very bottom of the page.
