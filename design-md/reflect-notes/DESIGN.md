## Overview

Reflect Notes is a starlit thinking environment: near-black canvas tinted with violet (#030014), illuminated text in a soft lavender-white, and a single vivid lavender accent (#9382ff) that functions as a point of focus against the dark. The interface stays monochromatic and quiet — surfaces are separated by inset rim-light glows rather than borders or elevation shadows, giving components the feel of dark glass panels catching ambient light. Display headlines use AeonikPro at weight 500 (deliberately medium, not bold), creating a calm editorial voice rather than marketing bombast. A pastel pink-to-violet-to-blue gradient is reserved exclusively for accent text and decorative strokes — never for large fills. Components are compact and tight: 5px button radii, 16px card radii, 4px base spacing. The whole system reads as a constellation map, not a dashboard.

## Color Palette

- **Void Canvas**: `#030014` — Page background, hero canvas, deepest surface layer — the near-black with violet undertone that defines the entire system's mood [neutral]
- **Midnight Surface**: `#060317` — Elevated surface, card backgrounds, slightly raised panels above the void canvas [neutral]
- **Deep Indigo**: `#10093a` — Most elevated surface, hover states, prominent UI panels — a step brighter than midnight surface; Filled button surface, deep brand surface for primary controls sitting on the void canvas [neutral]
- **Lilac White**: `#f4f0ff` — Primary text, headings, icons, high-contrast UI elements — white with a lavender cast that harmonizes with the violet canvas [neutral]
- **Pearl**: `#ffffff` — Pure white used sparingly for text on violet-filled elements and maximum-contrast headlines [neutral]
- **Ash**: `#a8a6b7` — Secondary body text, card labels — cool neutral with violet undertone [neutral]
- **Fog**: `#918ea0` — Tertiary text, metadata, helper text, inactive controls, border lines at full opacity [neutral]
- **Steel**: `#54525f` — Deepest muted text, disabled labels, dark-mode border contrast — the lowest readable neutral [neutral]
- **Mercury**: `#cdccd0` — Bright neutral used in dividers, subtle borders, and light-on-dark surface tints [neutral]
- **Dusk**: `#72707b` — Mid-neutral for secondary borders, inactive icon strokes, and subtle background tints [neutral]
- **Lavender Accent**: `#9382ff` — Brand accent — links, active icons, focus rings, gradient endpoints, highlight punctuation. The single chromatic signal in a monochrome system [brand]
- **Iris**: `#5046e4` — Violet supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color [brand]
- **Cosmic Gradient**: `#ba9cff` — Decorative gradient running from pink #e59cff through #ba9cff to blue #9cb2ff — used only on accent text and thin highlight strokes, never as a fill [accent]
- **Aurora**: `#7d62ff` — Vertical violet glow gradient used for divider lines and edge highlights — transparent at both ends, peaks at violet center [accent]

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1200px
- **Card Padding**: 24-32px
- **Element Gap**: 8-16px
- **Section Gap**: 96-120px
- **Border Radius**: {'cards': '16px', 'badges': '32px', 'inputs': '5px', 'buttons': '5px', 'navPill': '999px', 'featureBlocks': '24px'}

## Layout

Centered max-width ~1200px container with 24–48px horizontal page padding. Navigation is a floating pill centered at the top (not full-width). Hero is full-bleed with centered headline, subtitle, and a wide product screenshot below. Section rhythm: consistent 96–120px vertical gaps between sections, no alternating background colors (the entire page is the same void canvas). Feature sections use a 4-column grid (8 features in 2 rows of 4). Testimonial section uses a 3-column grid (6 testimonials in 2 rows of 3). All sections are center-aligned with the same max-width. No sidebar, no sticky elements beyond the floating nav pill. The page reads as one continuous dark scroll with rhythmic pauses between sections.

## Imagery

The primary visual element is a full product screenshot embedded in the hero showing the Reflect app interface — a dark-themed notes editor with sidebar navigation (Daily notes, All notes, Tasks, Map) and a monthly calendar widget. The screenshot sits on a subtle star-field background of tiny white dots scattered across the violet-black canvas. Below the hero, the visual content shifts to UI cards and feature blocks — no photography or illustration. Feature icons are stroke-based, 1.5px weight, outlined, and white. Avatars in testimonials are small circular photos. The gradient text on "Think better" (pink to blue) is the only chromatic illustration element. Overall: product-screenshot-forward, icons-only for features, no lifestyle photography or 3D renders.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Set body text in Inter V weight 400 at 16px/1.50, color #a8a6b7 or #f4f0ff — never use pure #ffffff for body copy, the lavender cast in #f4f0ff is intentional
- Use AeonikPro weight 500 at 48–72px for all headings — do not bold up to 600/700, the medium weight IS the brand
- Use 5px border-radius for all buttons, inputs, and interactive elements; 16px for all cards and containers; 32px for pill badges; 999px only for the nav container
- Apply inset white glow (rgba(255,255,255,0.04–0.06) 0px 0px 24px 0px inset) to elevated surfaces instead of drop shadows — this creates the rim-light glass effect
- Use #9382ff exclusively for links, active states, focus rings, and small accent icons — keep the violet accent sparse, it's punctuation not paint
- Use the cosmic gradient (#e59cff → #ba9cff → #9cb2ff) only on text and thin decorative strokes, never as a large fill or button background
- Set the page background to #030014 — the violet undertone is essential, do not use pure black #000000

### Don't

- Do not use bold (600+) or extra-bold (700+) weights for any text — the entire system is calibrated to medium and regular only
- Do not use drop shadows on cards or panels — all elevation is achieved through inset rim-light glows, not external shadows
- Do not add the brand accent color to large fills, backgrounds, or hero sections — it dilutes the monochromatic quiet
- Do not use border-radius values other than the defined set (5/16/32/999px) — do not default to 8px or 12px for buttons or 24px for cards
- Do not use pure white #ffffff for body text — always use the lavender-tinted #f4f0ff to maintain color harmony with the violet canvas
- Do not introduce semantic colors (red/green/yellow) for status — the system is intentionally achromatic, if states are needed use opacity changes and the lavender accent
- Do not use multiple accent hues — the single lavender #9382ff is the only chromatic voice; introducing a second accent breaks the constellation metaphor

### Text Link with Chevron

Inter V 15px weight 500 in #9382ff (lavender accent), with a right-arrow chevron icon. 8px radius. Used for "Learn more" and feature deep-links. On hover transitions to #f4f0ff.

### Star Field Background

Subtle dot/star pattern scattered across the hero section — tiny white dots (1–2px) at low opacity, creating a constellation effect on the #030014 canvas. Purely decorative, not interactive.

### Aurora Divider

Thin horizontal or vertical line using the Aurora gradient — transparent at endpoints, violet in center. Used to separate sections or decorate feature grids. ~1px height, full width or column-width.
