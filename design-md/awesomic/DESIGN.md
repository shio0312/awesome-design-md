## Overview

Awesomic operates in a restrained, neutral-first visual register: a zinc-gray scale carries nearly the entire interface, with one vivid orange badge accent and almost no other chromatic intrusion. The geometry is defined by generous corner rounding — 36px cards, 14px buttons, 10000px pills — and hairline 1px borders replace drop shadows as the primary elevation tool. Typography is a single custom geometric sans (Cosmica) deployed at bold display weights (56–64px / weight 600) for editorial headlines, paired with compact 14px body text that signals efficiency. The atmosphere is that of a confident, infrastructure-grade marketplace: quiet surfaces, precise density, and color deployed as functional punctuation rather than decoration.

## Color Palette

- **Obsidian**: `#09090b` — Primary action buttons, hero headlines, dominant text — the deepest near-black that grounds every dark CTA and display heading against the light canvas [neutral]
- **Graphite**: `#18181b` — Body text, nav text, badge text — the working ink color across paragraphs, links, and labels [neutral]
- **Slate**: `#27272a` — Secondary headings and elevated card surfaces — a mid-dark gray for cards that need visual weight [neutral]
- **Iron**: `#3f3f46` — Muted text, button labels on light surfaces, badge text — the mid-gray used for secondary UI labels and outlined-button text [neutral]
- **Steel**: `#52525b` — Icon strokes, supporting metadata — borders and icon outlines in darker contexts [neutral]
- **Fog**: `#71717a` — Helper text, tertiary labels — muted copy and supporting metadata [neutral]
- **Ash**: `#a1a1aa` — Placeholder text, disabled labels, light icon strokes — the lightest readable gray [neutral]
- **Mist**: `#d4d4d8` — Subtle borders, secondary card fills, link pill backgrounds — structural divider color [neutral]
- **Cloud**: `#ececee` — Primary border color across the system — 1px hairline rules on cards, badges, and inputs [neutral]
- **Paper**: `#f4f4f5` — Canvas background, card surfaces, badge fills — the warm-cool gray that carries the page surface [neutral]
- **Snow**: `#ffffff` — Elevated surfaces (cards on canvas), input fields, button backgrounds for ghost/neutral actions [neutral]
- **Ember**: `#ff5a00` — Accent badges (YC batch tags, highlight chips) — the single vivid color in the system, used sparingly for startup credentials and category emphasis [brand]
- **Magenta Spark**: `#fe45e2` — Rare decorative card accent — used on one hero card as visual punctuation against the monochrome grid [accent]

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1200px
- **Card Padding**: 28px
- **Element Gap**: 8px
- **Section Gap**: 80px
- **Border Radius**: {'cards': '36px', 'icons': '40px', 'pills': '10000px', 'badges': '12px', 'inputs': '14px', 'buttons': '14px'}

## Layout

The page follows a centered max-width (1200px) container with generous vertical rhythm (80px section gaps). The hero is a split composition: massive left-aligned headline (56–64px) with rotating keyword animation, paired with a compact right-aligned email-capture form and supporting paragraph. Below the hero, a horizontal scroll of category image-cards creates a portfolio band. The mid-page alternates light card sections with dark feature blocks — a rhythm of #f4f4f5 canvas, white cards, then inverted dark surface for pain-point lists. Stats appear as a horizontal row of three large-number blocks. A full-bleed nature photograph breaks the grid before testimonial/social-proof sections. Navigation is a sticky white top bar with logo left, centered nav links, and a dark CTA right. The overall feel is editorial-magazine meets marketplace dashboard: spacious section gaps but compact internal card density.

## Imagery

Photography plays a structural role rather than decorative: full-bleed landscape/macro nature shots (green moss, organic textures) serve as visual dividers between content sections, creating breath and warmth in an otherwise monochrome grid. Category cards use real product/work imagery — screenshots of apps, video thumbnails, design portfolios — filling the top half of rounded card containers. No illustrations or abstract graphics; no 3D renders. Logos in social-proof strips are desaturated to grayscale. Image treatment: no overlays, no duotone, no masks — raw photography with generous corner-radius (48–64px) to integrate with the rounded geometry of cards and sections. The overall density is image-medium: roughly 30–40% of viewport is photographic, concentrated in category showcases and breakthrough sections.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Use #09090b for all primary action buttons — the dark filled CTA is the system’s single most important interactive element
- Set card border-radius to 36px and rely on 1px solid #ececee borders instead of shadows for elevation
- Keep body text at 14–15px Cosmica weight 400 in #18181b — compact, dense, marketplace-grade
- Reserve #ff5a00 exclusively for YC-style accent badges and startup credential chips — never use it for general UI
- Use 56–64px Cosmica weight 600 with line-height 1.12–1.28 for hero and section display headlines
- Apply 28px padding inside cards and 80px vertical rhythm between major page sections
- Use 10000px border-radius for pill-shaped CTAs in the navigation, and 14px for inline action buttons

### Don't

- Do not introduce new accent colors — the system is 99% achromatic; adding blues, greens, or purples would break the restrained editorial register
- Do not use drop shadows on cards — hairline borders at 1px solid #ececee are the only permitted elevation on content surfaces
- Do not set display headlines below weight 600 — the bold weight is what makes the editorial typography read as authoritative
- Do not use #ff5a00 for body text, links, or large fills — it’s a badge color, not a brand color for general UI
- Do not use border-radius below 12px on any container — the system’s geometry is defined by generous rounding
- Do not break the single-font rule — Cosmica handles every typographic role from 10px badges to 64px displays
- Do not use pure black (#000000) — #09090b is the deepest permitted ink, keeping warmth in the neutrals

## Components

### Primary Action Button (Dark Filled)

Background #09090b, white text (#ffffff), 1.5px solid #2c2e34 border with subtle inset highlight shadow, 14px border-radius, 12px vertical / 16px horizontal padding, 14px Cosmica weight 400. The near-black fill with hairline border creates depth without a drop shadow.

### Ghost Action Button (White)

Background #ffffff, dark text (#3f3f46), 1px solid #3f3f46 border, 36px pill radius, 20px all padding, 14px Cosmica. Used in nav and contrasting on dark sections.

### Neutral Pill Button (Light)

Background #fafafa, text #18181b, 14px border-radius, 12px vertical / 16px horizontal padding, 14px Cosmica weight 400. No visible border — relies on the subtle background contrast.

### Category Card (Image Top)

Full-width image fills the top half, 36px border-radius, 28px bottom padding, no shadow. Title overlay or below image at 20px Cosmica weight 600. Tag pills sit inside the card at bottom.

### Dark Feature Card

Background #27272a or #18181b, white text, 28–36px border-radius, 24px padding. Each list item has a 20px Cosmica weight 500 with right-arrow accent. Creates a dark band that contrasts with the light page.

### Tag Pill Badge

Transparent background with 1px solid #ececee border, text #18181b, 12px border-radius, 4px vertical / 8px horizontal padding, 12–13px Cosmica weight 400. Hairline border treatment keeps tags quiet.

### Filled Tag Badge

Background #3f3f46, text #fafafa, 12px border-radius, 4px/8px padding. Used for skill/category labels that need more visual weight than outlined tags.

### Orange Accent Badge

Background #ff5a00, white text, 12px border-radius, 4px/8px padding. The sole chromatic badge — reserved for startup credibility signals and category emphasis.

### Email Input Field

White background (#ffffff), text #333333, 14px border-radius, 12px vertical / 16px horizontal padding, 1px transparent border. Pairs directly with a dark CTA button to its right.

### Logo Strip

Grayscale logos (Coca-Cola, Disney, Genesis, Udemy, EY) rendered in #71717a at 60–70% opacity, horizontally centered with even spacing. No background container.

### Stats Block

Large number at 40–56px Cosmica weight 600 in #09090b, adjacent descriptor at 14px weight 400 in #52525b. Minimal spacing between number and label.

### Breakthrough Image Section

Full-width photographic image (no overlay, no text), 48px or 64px corner radius on top corners, functions as a visual breath between content sections.

### Navigation Bar

Sticky white header, logo left, nav links center (14px Cosmica), login + dark CTA button right. No visible border — floats on canvas.

## Geometry Philosophy

The system’s spatial language is defined by three radii that repeat everywhere: 12px for tags and small controls, 14px for buttons and inputs, and 36px for cards and large surfaces. Pill shapes (10000px) appear only in navigation CTAs. This creates a consistent visual rhythm where corners curve generously on containers but stay controlled on interactive elements. No sharp corners (0px) are used on visible UI — even the smallest chips get 12px rounding. The asymmetry between 14px (buttons) and 36px (cards) is deliberate: buttons feel precise and contained, cards feel inviting and spacious.
