## Overview

NCDA operates as a printed monograph translated to the web: paper-white canvas, a single near-black ink, zero chromatic noise, and type that does the structural work that color usually does. The signature move is the wordmark itself — rendered at architectural scale and cropped by the viewport edge, it turns the brand mark into a layout device rather than a logo. Navigation is reduced to essentials: a live dual-city clock in the corner, a single 'Menu' trigger, and a tight gray description block. The system alternates between vast white negative space and occasional full-bleed black bands, creating an exhibition-catalogue rhythm. Components are sparse and unornamented — no shadows, no rounded corners, no buttons — just hairline rules, generous margins, and type that whispers through tight negative tracking at display sizes and slightly positive tracking at caption sizes.

## Color Palette

- **Onyx**: `#191919` — Primary text, hairline borders, full-bleed dark surface bands — the near-black ink of the system [neutral]
- **Pure Black**: `#000000` — Secondary text fills, deepest borders, and image overlays where maximum contrast against white is required [neutral]
- **Paper**: `#ffffff` — Page canvas, surface backgrounds, inverse text on dark bands [neutral]
- **Concrete**: `#808080` — Secondary descriptive text, muted link borders, subdued meta-information — the gray of footnotes and captions [neutral]

## Typography

- **TWK Everett**
- **TWK Everett Mono**

## Type Scale

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| caption | 11 | — | 1.44 |
| body | 15 | — | 1.44 |
| subheading | 21 | — | 1.4 |
| heading | 32 | — | 1.35 |
| display | 62 | — | 0.8 |

## Spacing & Layout

- **Card Padding**: 0px
- **Element Gap**: 15px
- **Section Gap**: 64-150px
- **Border Radius**: {'tags': '0px', 'cards': '0px', 'inputs': '0px', 'buttons': '0px'}

## Layout

Full-bleed page with no max-width container. The hero section is an asymmetric composition: the studio description block sits in the upper-right quadrant (approximately 59px from its left edge, aligned to roughly the 45% mark horizontally), while the cropped 'NCDA' wordmark dominates the lower 60% of the viewport, bleeding off the left and right edges. The top edge holds a thin utility row: dual-city clock at top-left, Menu trigger at top-right, with vast white space between. Section rhythm alternates between white canvas pages and full-bleed #191919 dark bands — each band likely a project showcase or image set. Content within white pages is left-aligned and column-based rather than centered. Navigation is minimal: a single Menu trigger, no visible nav bar, no breadcrumbs, no footer structure visible in the frames.

## Surfaces / Elevation

- **Paper White**
- **Onyx Black**

## Imagery

The visual language is type-first and textural rather than photographic. The hero is pure typography — no image, no illustration, no decorative element. The dark band functions as a container for project photography or video, but the photography itself is not visible in the provided frames. The expected treatment, based on the architectural-studio genre and the monochrome system, is high-contrast interior photography: sharp geometric compositions of spaces, materials, and light, presented uncropped and full-bleed within the #191919 bands. No illustrations, no abstract graphics, no icons visible in the interface. The wordmark itself is the primary visual asset.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Use TWK Everett Regular (400) at every size from 11px to 62px — never introduce bold or medium weights, the single-weight system is the signature
- Set the wordmark or any display text at 62px with -0.05em letter-spacing and line-height 0.80 to create the continuous architectural band effect
- Apply +0.04em letter-spacing to all text at 11px and below — the positive tracking is what makes captions read as technical annotations rather than body type
- Crop type and imagery at the viewport edge — the bleed is structural, never add padding to prevent it
- Use #191919 Onyx for all borders and dark surface bands; reserve #000000 Pure Black for text fills where maximum contrast is critical
- Separate content sections with full-bleed #191919 bands — no gradients, no soft transitions between white and dark
- Keep interactive elements text-only — no buttons, no icons, no filled rectangles; use 1px #808080 hairline rules to indicate links

### Don't

- Do not introduce any chromatic color — the system is 0% colorfulness by design, any hue breaks the monograph language
- Do not add border-radius to any element — all corners are sharp 0px, rounded shapes would undermine the architectural print language
- Do not use drop shadows or elevation effects — depth comes from scale and negative space, not from shadow stacks
- Do not set body or paragraph type at 62px — that size is reserved for the wordmark and display headlines that function as layout architecture
- Do not use more than two type sizes on a single screen — the system relies on extreme size contrast (15px body vs 62px display), intermediate sizes dilute the rhythm
- Do not add icons, arrows, or decorative glyphs to the Menu trigger or any navigation — the plain text label is the entire affordance
- Do not center-align body text — left-align everything; centering is reserved for the wordmark, everything else hangs from a left edge

## Components

### Architectural Wordmark Display

The 'NCDA' letterform set in TWK Everett Regular at 62px, line-height 0.80, letter-spacing -0.05em (#3.1px). The string is sized to overflow the viewport horizontally and is allowed to bleed off both edges — the crop is intentional. No margin, no padding, sits flush against the page boundaries. Color: #000000 on white, or #ffffff when placed on a #191919 band.

### Dual-City Live Clock

Two monospaced time displays in the top-left corner, formatted as 'HH:MM:SS CITY'. TWK Everett 11px, weight 400, letter-spacing +0.04em, color #000000. Separated by a horizontal gap of ~53px. The mono treatment and tabular spacing make the seconds tick without jitter.

### Menu Trigger

Plain text 'Menu' in TWK Everett 15px, weight 400, color #000000, no border, no background. Aligned flush to the right edge of the viewport. No icon, no chevron, no affordance decoration.

### Studio Description Block

Three-line paragraph set in TWK Everett 15px, line-height ~1.44, max-width approximately 400px. The studio name 'NC Design and Architecture Ltd.' is bolded or given a slight emphasis. Remainder in #808080 Concrete gray, with the brand name in #000000. Positioned in the upper-right quadrant, approximately 59px from the left edge of its column, creating a deliberate asymmetric counterweight to the cropped wordmark below.

### Full-Bleed Dark Band

A 100vw × full-height band filled with #191919, no border, no radius, no shadow. Image or video content fills the band edge-to-edge. The transition from white to this band is abrupt — no gradient, no fade. Acts as a visual exhale between white pages.

### Hairline Rule Link

Text link in TWK Everett 15px, color #000000, with a 1px #808080 bottom border acting as underline. No hover state color change specified — the border is the link, not the text color.

### Time-Indexed Label

Small caption text at 11px in #808080, letter-spacing +0.04em, used for project numbers, dates, or category labels. No background, no border, no badge shape — just spaced gray type.

**Example Component Prompts**
1. Build the landing hero: white #ffffff canvas. Top-left: two monospaced timestamps '09:58:21 HK' and '21:58:21 NYC' in TWK Everett 11px, weight 400, letter-spacing +0.04em (0.44px), color #000000, separated by 53px gap. Top-right: 'Menu' in TWK Everett 15px, weight 400, #000000, flush right. Upper-right quadrant: description block ~400px wide, 'NC Design and Architecture Ltd.' in #000000, remainder in #808080, TWK Everett 15px, line-height 1.44, 59px left padding. Lower 60%: 'NCDA' in TWK Everett 62px, line-height 0.80, letter-spacing -3.1px (-0.05em), #000000, sized to overflow viewport horizontally and crop on both edges.

2. Build a project section band: full-viewport-width rectangle, background #191919, height 100vh, no border, no radius, no shadow. Image inside fills the band edge-to-edge with no padding or margin.

3. Build a time-indexed label: plain text in TWK Everett 11px, weight 400, color #808080, letter-spacing +0.04em, no background, no border, no badge shape — just spaced gray type inline with content.

## Typographic Signature

The single-weight (400 only) typographic system across a 5x size range is unusual and intentional. Most design systems use multiple weights to create hierarchy; NCDA uses scale alone. The result is a voice that never shouts — even the 62px display reads as calm authority rather than visual impact. The negative tracking at display sizes (-0.05em) tightens the wordmark into a near-continuous stroke, and the positive tracking at caption sizes (+0.04em) makes metadata feel technical and annotated. This dual-tracking polarity is a signature that should never be flattened to 'normal' letter-spacing.
