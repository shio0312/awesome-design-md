## Overview

Antimetal operates in a quiet editorial register: warm cream paper, a distinctive contemporary serif (Test Signifier) at weight 400 for every headline, and an almost entirely achromatic palette where color appears only as a small constellation of decorative dots and a single muted chartreuse accent. The visual grammar borrows from print design — drop caps, pull quotes, section numbering in tracked monospace, dashed hairline dividers — rather than from typical SaaS dashboards. Components are flat and pill-shaped; the navigation is a liquid-glass capsule; borders are dashed 1px at 10% black opacity. Everything whispers, even the CTA. The serif at regular weight doing the work of bold is the single most defining choice: Antimetal does not shout authority, it earns it through typographic restraint and generous breathing room.

## Color Palette

- **Parchment**: `#d7d7d0` — Page canvas — warm gray field that recedes behind content, used as the dominant full-bleed background [neutral]
- **Cream**: `#f7f6f3` — Primary surface — card backgrounds, FAQ rows, section bands, pulled slightly warmer than white to avoid clinical feel [neutral]
- **Bone**: `#fdfcfa` — Elevated card surface — nearly white with a faint warm cast, for content blocks that need to feel slightly above the cream layer [neutral]
- **Bistre**: `#1a1614` — Primary text, dark filled buttons, active strokes — warm near-black that replaces pure #000, never harsh on the cream [neutral]
- **Graphite**: `#66635f` — Secondary body text, nav labels, supporting copy — the workhorse mid-tone that keeps paragraphs quiet [neutral]
- **Flint**: `#a8a7a1` — Muted helper text, dashed dividers, disabled chrome, low-emphasis stroke — sits between graphite and the canvas [neutral]
- **Slate**: `#53504c` — Tertiary text and sub-labels — slightly darker than graphite for labels that need quiet emphasis [neutral]
- **Ash**: `#2a2724` — Hover/pressed state on dark buttons and video timestamp chips — a mid-point between bistre and black [neutral]
- **Quill**: `#e3e3de` — Hairline dividers, ghost button borders, nav capsule background, tab resting surface — the lightest warm gray that still reads as a line [neutral]
- **Chartreuse Whisper**: `#e2e67d` — Sole chromatic accent — appears as a small punctuation mark, badge fill, or highlight wash; deliberately desaturated so it never dominates [accent]

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| caption | 10 | — | 1.2 |

## Spacing & Layout

- **Max Width**: 1200px
- **Card Padding**: 40px
- **Element Gap**: 16px
- **Section Gap**: 120px
- **Border Radius**: {'cards': '4px', 'buttons': '9999px', 'nav-capsule': '82px', 'pills-large': '999px'}

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered content with full-bleed warm-gray sections. The hero is a two-column split: headline + subtext + button pair on the left (60% width), network visualization on the right (40%). Below the hero, sections alternate between cream and parchment backgrounds with generous 120px vertical gaps. Section openers use a two-column header: serif heading left, short descriptor right. Content blocks are either two-column (text + media) or single-column centered. The FAQ uses a full-width accordion constrained to the content max-width. The research log is a single-column text list. Navigation is a floating liquid-glass capsule centered at the top, not a full-width bar. Buttons are always paired (filled + ghost) and never stacked alone.

## Surfaces / Elevation

- **Parchment Canvas**
- **Cream Surface**
- **Bone Card**
- **Quill Line**

## Imagery

Minimal photographic content. The hero pairs text with a single decorative graphic — a radial network/dandelion of colored dots (black, chartreuse, warm orange, olive) connected by fine lines to a single center point, representing autonomous agents radiating from a system. Video content appears as dark, high-contrast thumbnails with a centered cream play button. The Google logo in the testimonial is rendered as a grayscale image. No lifestyle photography, no product screenshots, no 3D renders. The page is 90% typography and white space; when imagery appears it is either the signature network graphic or a single video frame.

## Design Principles

### Do

- Set all headings in Test Signifier weight 400 — never bold the serif, the entire brand identity depends on the quiet authority of regular weight doing display work.
- Use 1px dashed borders in #1a1614 at 10% opacity for all dividers and accordion separators; solid lines are reserved for button outlines and the nav capsule.
- Pair every primary CTA (dark pill) with a secondary ghost outlined button; never let the dark pill stand alone in a button group.
- Number every major section with a Geist Mono 10–11px uppercase marker at letter-spacing 0.1em in #66635f, format as "05 · SECTION NAME".
- Keep the canvas at #d7d7d0 (warm gray) and surfaces at #f7f6f3 (cream); never use pure white or pure black — the warm cast is the signature.
- Reserve chartreuse #e2e67d for single-element accents (one badge, one highlight, one dot); it must never appear as a fill on large surfaces.
- Use the 82px pill radius for the navigation capsule and 9999px for buttons; cards and dividers stay rectangular at 0–4px.

### Don't

- Do not bold any heading — Test Signifier at weight 400 is non-negotiable; introducing 600/700 destroys the editorial register.
- Do not use solid borders for content separators; dashed 1px is the only hairline treatment allowed inside the page.
- Do not place more than one filled dark button per viewport; the dark pill loses authority when repeated.
- Do not introduce saturated blue, red, or green for buttons or alerts; the only chromatic color is the desaturated chartreuse accent.
- Do not use drop shadows on cards or content blocks; depth is achieved through the liquid-glass nav and warm-gray layering only.
- Do not set body text in the serif — Geist handles all body, nav, and UI; the serif is display-only.
- Do not use the network/dandelion graphic in contexts other than the hero; it is a singular signature, not a reusable pattern.

## Components

### Dark Pill Button

Background #1a1614, text #f4f4e7, full-pill radius 9999px, padding 12.5px vertical / 24.5px horizontal, font Geist 14px weight 500. The warm dark fill on warm cream paper reads as confident rather than aggressive. Used for "Book a demo" and primary conversions. Never appears more than once per viewport.

### Ghost Outlined Button

Transparent background, border 1px solid in current text color at 92% opacity (#1a1614 at 0.92), text #1a1614, radius 0px (rectangular not pill), padding 24px on all sides, Geist 14px weight 500. The sharp corners deliberately contrast the pill's softness, making the two-button pair read as a typographic rhythm rather than a hierarchy of importance.

### Liquid-Glass Navigation Capsule

Floating pill shape with radius 82px, backdrop-filter blur(8–24px) saturate(1.75–1.8) brightness(1.1), semi-transparent fill #cfcfc8bd, inset shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 0 10px 0 for depth, 1px hairline border. Internal layout: left-aligned secondary links, centered wordmark with antimetallic icon glyph, right-aligned sign-in + dark pill CTA. Sits over content with visible refraction.

### FAQ Accordion Row

Background #f7f6f3, no radius, padding 20–24px vertical, 1px dashed border on all sides at #1a1614 10% opacity (the dashed hairline is the signature separator style). Question text in Test Signifier 24px weight 400, plus icon right-aligned in Bistre. Expanded state reveals body copy in Geist 16px below the dashed divider.

### Section Header with Monospace Marker

Two-line composition: top line is "05 · FAQ" or "06 · STAY UP TO DATE" in Geist Mono 10–11px uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em, color #66635f. Below, the section heading in Test Signifier 36–48px weight 400 in Bistre. A short descriptor paragraph in Geist 20px color #66635f sits beside the heading in a two-column layout for the FAQ section.

### Drop Cap Body Paragraph

First letter of the first paragraph rendered as a large outlined initial cap in Test Signifier at roughly 2.2x the body size, positioned with negative margin to overlap the line above. Body text in Geist 16px line-height 1.5 color Bistre. Used for the "Production engineering, as practiced today…" essay block. Creates a magazine-article cadence uncommon in tech product sites.

### Pull Quote Block

Large quote in Test Signifier 36–48px weight 400 with curly opening quote " above, attribution below in Geist 14px — name in Bistre, role/company in Graphite. Quote marks are typographic, not glyphs. Paired with a video thumbnail on the left in a two-column layout. No background, no border — floats in the cream space.

### Video Thumbnail Card

Rectangular video still with a centered circular play button (cream fill, dark triangle icon) overlaid. Duration timestamp "2:07" in a small dark pill (#2a2724 background, cream text) bottom-left, brand mark bottom-right. No border or radius beyond a small 4px clip on the timestamp chip. Photographic content is high-contrast with desaturated tones to match the achromatic system.

### Research Log Entry

Single-line entry with post title in Test Signifier 24px color Bistre, metadata in Geist Mono 10px uppercase tracked: date, author, read time. Title is the link; hover shifts color to Graphite. Separated from neighbors by 1px dashed #1a1614 10% border. Compressed, text-forward, no thumbnails — the list reads like a table of contents.

### Network Visualization Graphic

Radiating lines from a single center point terminating in small filled circles in four colors: Bistre black, Chartreuse yellow, warm orange (#f59e3a), and olive (#9a9d3e). Lines drawn in Flint at 0.3–0.5px. No animation by default. Occupies the right half of the hero on desktop, sits below headline on mobile. Functions as the only multi-color element on the page.

### View All Outlined Button

Rectangular with 1px solid border in Bistre, Geist 14px weight 500, padding 12px 24px, radius 0. Sits right-aligned in section footers. Subordinate to the dark pill and ghost outlined button — it is the quietest of the three button treatments and never appears in the hero.

Pair it with a dark video thumbnail on the left with a centered circular cream play button and a "2:07" timestamp chip in #2a2724 at bottom-left.

4. Build a research log entry row: 1px dashed bottom border #1a1614 at 10% opacity, padding 20px vertical, title in Test Signifier 24px weight 400 #1a1614, metadata prefix in Geist Mono 10px uppercase tracked 1px #66635f reading "04/16/2026" and author + read time, separator dot in Geist 16px #66635f.

5. Build the navigation capsule: floating pill with 82px radius, backdrop-filter blur(12px) saturate(1.75), semi-transparent fill #cfcfc8bd, inset shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 0 10px 0, 1px hairline border. Left: nav links in Geist 14px weight 500 #1a1614. Center: wordmark with small icon. Right: "Sign In" text link in Geist 14px + dark pill button #1a1614 fill #f4f4e7 text radius 9999px.

## Motion & Glass Philosophy

Antimetal's motion is restrained but expressive: 0.15–0.3s durations with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing on color, background, border, and stroke transitions. The signature glass effect uses layered backdrop-filter: blur(8–24px) saturate(1.75–1.8) brightness(1.1) combined with an SVG liquid-glass filter for refraction. A single 'pulse' animation runs on the network graphic's center point. Longer 0.6–0.7s eases with cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) handle entrance animations on scroll. Never use linear easing; never animate layout properties.

## Editorial Conventions

Antimetal treats every page like a printed research document. Specific conventions: section numbering as monospace eyebrows ("05 · FAQ"), drop caps on first paragraphs of long-form blocks, curly typographic quote marks (not straight), en-dashes in metadata, and dashed 1px hairlines as the sole separator style. The Test Signifier serif is set with negative letter-spacing at all sizes above 24px (-0.021em at 48px, -0.037em at 54px) — this tightens the serif's natural rhythm and keeps large headlines from feeling loose or decorative.
